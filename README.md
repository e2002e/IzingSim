# IzingSim

Model of Izing computations test.  

COMPILE:  
make

USAGE:  
./izing <string representing the spins>  
./izing 100110001  

From then you have an interactive menu thanks to ncurses, which makes it a linux exclusive program.  
The code is verified and complete in dimention 1, but don't use ring and longrange in dimension 2 as it will yield false results.  
I am having issues keeping the math doctor who is involed alive because of fake hashish which he says "stones him more than weed".  
If I get to see him again we'll finish dimension 2 and include more computations.
